<p>Hi there! I'm <b>Kyle Lierer</b>.</p>
<p>Hi! I am Kyle Lierer! I am a fullstack cloud application developer with a passion for technology, design, and helping impact people through some pretty cool tech. Currently, I serve as an AWS Associate Consultant at <a href="https://www.slalom.com/">Slalom</a> in Columbus, OH. I am also a computer science graduate from <a href="https://miamioh.edu/">Miami University</a> in Oxford, OH.</p>
<p>As a fullstack cloud application developer, I have a natural knack for system design and building scalable solutions for any problem whether it be a portfolio site, a content management system, or a completely custom built solution. Feel free to checkout my projects to get an idea of my experience(s) and/or contact me if you have any questions or just want to reach out!</p>
